Today was mostly focused around getting the right hardware into the right people's hands! Lots of requests for new headsets,
mouse + keyboard combos, and webcams that were taken care of. We also dealt with a few networking issues, namely making sure
that the Azure VM's that we run were accessible to those who need them. At the end of my day, I spent some time re-imaging a
computer with the correct software to be sent down to another branch.
